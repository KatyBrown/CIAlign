def findLowCoverage(boolarr, sums, height, width, min_size, max_size):
    '''
    Finds regions of the alignment with coverage <50%, as insertions gaps must
    be found in the majority of sequences to be removed -
    regions with >=50% coverage can never meet this criteria.
    Generates a list of arrays, each of which is the indices of a group of
    consecutive positions with coverage in <50% of columns. The groups
    must have length >= min_size and < max_size.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    boolarr: np.array
        Boolean numpy array the same shape as the alignment where residues are
        True and gaps are False.
    sums: np.array
        Integer array showing the total number of non-gaps in each column
        of the alignment
    height: int
        Alignment height (number of sequences)
    width: int
        Alignment width (number of columns)
    min_size: int
        Minimum size insertions to remove
